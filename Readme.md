🔍 Ever wondered what drives high spending among different customer segments? 🚀 I recently delved into this with an analysis using Python, focusing on a small dataset for a shopping center.
 
𝐐𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐒𝐧𝐚𝐩𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐭:
- 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐃𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐬: Females (112) slightly outnumber males (88).
- 𝐀𝐠𝐞 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭: Customers aged 26-35 lead in average spending scores, while the 18-25 age group surprises with the second-highest scores despite lower incomes.
- 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Notably, a reverse relationship surfaces as individuals above the age of 40 tend to have a spending score of 60 or less.
- 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬: The majority have a yearly income below 78K, with 50% below 61.5k.

1. 𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐃𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐬: Tailor marketing strategies for younger customers with higher average spending scores.
